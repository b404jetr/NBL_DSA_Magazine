# HLC HEROES Magazine

**An online magazine for the High-Loan-Category Direct Selling Agent (HLC DSA) cohort**, designed to inspire, recognize, and empower DSAs through engaging stories, practical tools, leaderboards, and community events.

---

## Project Overview

HLC HEROES is a mobile-first, React-based Single Page Application (SPA) that delivers magazine content dynamically from JSON data files. It includes sections such as Cover Story, Hall of Fame, DSA Toolbox, Payout Board, Events & Summits, and Leaderboard — all focused on showcasing the hustle, success, and ecosystem of DSAs.

This project is optimized for deployment on Vercel with fast, scalable edge hosting, and supports easy content updates without code changes by editing simple JSON files.

## Updating Content

Modify the `src/data/magazineData.json` file to update any content on the site (cover stories, leaderboards, hall of fame, etc.). For large-scale or real-time content management, this can be replaced by fetching data from an API or connected CMS.

1. Push your local repo to GitHub or any Git provider.

2. Log in to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and import your repository.

3. Configure build settings (React apps work out-of-the-box):

   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `build`

4. Deploy and get a live URL with automatic global CDN for blazing-fast access.

5. For updates, modify JSON and redeploy or connect a webhook to automate.
